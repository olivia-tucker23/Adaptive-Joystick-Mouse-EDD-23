# Adaptive-Joystick-Mouse-EDD-23
This repository contains the CircuitPython code used in my PLTW Engineering Design &amp; Development high school capstone project: The Adaptive Joystick Mouse.

The Adaptive Joystick Mouse is an accessible joystick mouse designed to be low-cost, modern, modular, and accessible to a wide range of people. It utilizes the same basic Adafruit components in a variety of mounting solutions, joystick top solutions, colors, sizes, and more. The goal is to create a library of options that users can choose from to make a device that is ideal for their specific wants and needs. All plastic parts are 3D printed, and all other parts can be easily purchaed online. 

The project is not yet complete, and is still being tested and iterated on. 

Project as a whole is not currently open source.
